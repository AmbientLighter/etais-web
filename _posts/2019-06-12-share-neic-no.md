(This news is an adapted version of https://www.csc.fi/en/-/hae-neicin-dellingr-projektin-laskentaresursseja .)

The NeIC (Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration) Dellingr project is pleased to announce that the new cross-border Nordic resource sharing is now open. The call is in effect continuously.

Dellingr has a pool of compute time available for smaller projects for which 50 000 core hours is enough but need immediate access to the compute resource.

The applications will be reviewed by the Dellingr project and the resources assigned with a quick response time from submitting the application.

The NeIC is an organisation that facilitates the development and operation of high-quality e-Infrastructure solutions in areas of joint Nordic interest. The NeIC is administered by NordForsk and funded by national research funding agencies.
