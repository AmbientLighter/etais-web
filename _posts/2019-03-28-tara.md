title: "ETAIS self-service now accepts European identities"
---

[ETAIS self-service](https://minu.etais.ee/) has been recently integrated with Estonian State Authentication Service
TARA. Among others methods, it allows to login using eIDAS identity providers, which brings us closer to a transparent
and pan-European reliable authentication. At the moment citizens of Germany and Spain can access the service with
more countries in the pipeline.
