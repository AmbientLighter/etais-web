As you can see, ETAIS project has moved to a brand new website powered by Jekyll.   

The new website is to replace an old Wordpress one that was really getting old and need to retire.  

As for the new one - we are right now filling it up with information about ETAIS project and its members and contributors. We aim to add a blog and many useful user guides.   

We would be happy to get your feedback about this page. Whenever you feel like something important is missing or could be better or different, don't hesitate to let us know.
