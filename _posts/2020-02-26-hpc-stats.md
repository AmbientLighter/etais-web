title: "Estonian HPC centers have delivered over 10 millennia of CPU usage in 2019"
---

The three computational centers comprising ETAIS have delivered in total 10367 CPU*years for
research communities in Estonia. A split and more details can be seen in the chart below.

We exclude from the chart GPU usage, the demand for which has greatly increased over the last year
as it is confusing to compare them to CPUs without skewing the data.

We expect the number to grow further in 2020 and even more so once EuroHPC LUMI
becomes operational in 2021.
