title: "Estonian HPC centers have delivered almost a millennium of CPU usage in 2019"
---

The three computational centers comprising ETAIS have delivered in total 864 CPU*years for
research communities in Estonia. A split and more details can be seen in the chart below.

We exclude from the chart GPU usage, the demand for which has greatly increased over the last year
as it confusing to compare them to CPUs without skewing the data.

We expect to breach the symbolic 1000 CPU*year consumption in 2020 and go even further once EuroHPC LUMI
becomes operational.
