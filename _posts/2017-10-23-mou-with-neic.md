We are happy to announce that ETAIS has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with
the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (<a href="https://neic.no/about/">NeIC</a>). NeIC
is a consolidated effort of Nordic countries to develop and operate state-of-the-art
e-Infrastructure services.

The MoU will provide an opportunity for NeIC and ETAIS to actively work together on areas of interest
that span national borders and regions.
