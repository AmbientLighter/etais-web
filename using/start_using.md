ETAIS is intended for research communities in Estonia as well as R&D companies. To get access to the resources,
an usage agreement must be made signed ETAIS and an organization willing to join.

>  Please send an email [etais@etais.ee](mailto:etais@etais.ee) if you want to join!

Once an organization account has been created, provisioning and access to its resources is configured through
the self-service portal. To access it you need an account from [TaaT](http://taat.edu.ee/) or
[eduGAIN](https://www.geant.org/Services/Trust_identity_and_security/eduGAIN).
